# The Genre Browser

The Genre Browser is a web app that allows the user to explore through the many
hundreds of Echo Nest genres. Specifically the user can see:

 - a brief description of the genre
 - a list of similar genres
 - the set of top artists for that genre (which are linked to the echotron)
 - A set of playlists:
 	- intro - canonical songs meant to introduce the genre
 	- current - most popular being played today
 	- emerging - unfamiliar to most listeners

    The user can listen to playlists via Spotify
 	
 The app is hosted at [The Genre Browser](http://static.echonest.com/GenreBrowser/)
